      <h2>What we believe?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Kids are self learners. You donâ€™t teach them, just build an ideal
          environment for them to blossom.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building an ideal environment is teamwork. A team comprising of
          parents, educator, mentor and fellow like-minded learners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kids are smarter than adults. Adults have to work hard to keep up with
          kids.
